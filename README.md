Underscore.php
==============
Underscore.php is a PHP port of [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/).

This is a fork of Brian Haveri's Underscore.php. I have removed the
object-oriented way of calling the functions, and changed all functions to
static. This eliminates the E_STRICT warnings under PHP >=5.4.

In addition to porting Underscore's functionality, Underscore.php includes matching unit tests. Thanks to Jeremy Ashkenas and all contributors to Underscore.js.
